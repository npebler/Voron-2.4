# Voron 2.4
Klipper (**[Kalico/Danger-Klipper](https://github.com/KalicoCrew/kalico)**) with **[Klippain](https://github.com/Frix-x/klippain)** config files<br />

The whole point of this repo is to have a backup of all of my files while I mess with the printer.<br />

Currently I am working on:<br />
Printing and adding the **[Box Turtle AMS](https://github.com/ArmoredTurtle/BoxTurtle)** system<br />
Adding a filament cutter to my **[XOL toolhead](https://github.com/Armchair-Heavy-Industries/Xol-Toolhead)**<br /><br />

This is my Voron 2.4 with a bunch of custom things:<br />

- **[Manta M8P](https://github.com/bigtreetech/Manta-M8P)** v1.1
- CM4 4gb (had issues with CANBUS with the CB1 so I upgraded to a CM4)
- **[BTT EBB36 v1.2](https://github.com/bigtreetech/EBB)** Toolhead board
- **[ERCF V2.0](https://github.com/Enraged-Rabbit-Community/ERCF_v2)** (switching to BT ams) <br />
