# Voron 2.4
- Klipper (Kalico/Danger-Klipper) with Klippain config files\n\n

The whole point of this repo is to have a backup of all of my files while I mess with the printer.\n
Currently I am working on:\n
Printing and adding the **[Box Turtle AMS](https://github.com/ArmoredTurtle/BoxTurtle)** system\n
Adding a filament cutter to my XOL toolhead\n\n

This is my Voron 2.4 with a bunch of custom things:\n
It was all based off the **[formbot](https://www.formbot3d.com/products/voron-24-r2-pro-corexy-3d-printer-kit-with-m8p-cb1-board-and-canbus-wiring-system?VariantsId=10457)** 2.4 kit\n
**[Manta M8P](https://github.com/bigtreetech/Manta-M8P)** v1.1\n
CM4 4gb (had issues with CANBUS with the CB1 so I upgraded to a CM4)\n
**[BTT EBB36 v1.2](https://github.com/bigtreetech/EBB)** Toolhead (switching to BT ams)\n
**[ERCF V2.0](https://github.com/Enraged-Rabbit-Community/ERCF_v2)**\n\n

**[LDO Box Turtle Kit](https://www.fabreeko.com/products/box-turtle?variant=46305056096511)**\n
