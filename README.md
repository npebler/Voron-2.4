Voron 2.4 - Klipper (Kalico/Danger-Klipper) with Klippain config files

The whole point of this repo is to have a backup of all of my files while I mess with the printer.
Currently I am working on:
Printing and adding the Box Turtle AMS system
Adding a filament cutter to my XOL toolhead

This is my Voron 2.4 with a bunch of custom things:
It was all based off the formbot 2.4 kit
Manta M8P v1.1
CM4 4gb (had issues with CANBUS with the CB1 so I upgraded to a CM4)
BTT EBB36 v1.2 Toolhead
ERCF V2.0 (switching to BT ams)

LDO Box Turtle Kit
